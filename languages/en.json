"what_is_bbs":"About BBS coin",

Members who opt-in can then exchange their BBS coins with other members or withdraw to their own BBS wallet for holding(also known as hodl) or may send it to their account's BBS address on one of the Exchanges where BBS coin is listed on to exchange for other cryptocurrencies like BitCoin(BTC) and LiteCoin(LTC). We use Cryptonight Lite v7 as the algorithm for the software.",
"what_is_bbs_content":"Because BBS is a coin then it makes it mineable, meaning you could share your computing power with a BBS mining pool(see under ECOSYSTEM) to help find new blocks on the blockchain which holds the records of newly created transactions and help confirm them by verifying the balance of the senders of the transactions with previous blocks. You will get a share of the reward for helping find the next block (Check the current 'Reward' under the next section).",
